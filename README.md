## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

Please report bugs, issues, or suggestions on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/mitgobla/Deep-Rock-Galactic-Mods/issues).

Where possible, please provide logs from your game. My Mod Manager generates logs that can be found in the following location:

1. Navigate to your game installation folder.
2. Once inside `\Deep Rock Galactic\` folder, navigate to the `\FSD\Mods\mitgobla` directory.
3. Copy the contents of the `latest.txt` file for the last logs produced by the game.

## 🔧 Configuring Mods

Most of my mods can be configured in-game, by using [Mod Hub](https://mod.io/g/drg/m/mod-hub) or [Unified UI](https://mod.io/g/drg/m/unified-ui). My mod manager also provides configuration files for most of my mods, which can be found in the following location:

1. Navigate to your game installation folder.
2. Once inside `\Deep Rock Galactic\` folder, navigate to the `\FSD\Mods\mitgobla` directory.
3. Open the respective config file (these end with `.ini.txt`), and edit it as needed.
